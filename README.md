imlib2-bpg
---

Loader for [BPG image format][1] for Imlib2 (i.e. for [Feh][2]).

Usage
---

1. Ensure Imlib2 development things (like `libimlib2-dev`) are installed;
2. Build libbpg (for example, v0.9.3. Don't worry if you can't build `bpgenc` or `bpgdec` due to missing png or jpg libraries - we need only `libbpg.a`);
3. Adjust BPGDIR in `makefile`;
4. Build and install `bpg.so`.
